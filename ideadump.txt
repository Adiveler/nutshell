TODO: hide head for PREVIEW bubble?!?! // if head in embed-modal, fuggedaboutit css

- don't understand why "Loop from 8082" doesn't work.
- glitch with arrow at bigger font sizes???!??!
- Bubble after punctuation
- HIDDEN PARAGRAPHS if :?
- "Like this: click" Better
- Refactor, make everything simpler & more understandable.

- MAYBE: also hide paragraphs starting with ":", to indicate content
  that should only be shown when embedded elsewhere, NOT top-level?

- Forgiving Search <b> & paragraphs, full article
- Images/Iframe/Plugins etc
- Latex

- (MAYBE: also allow on-hover modal expand?)

- If no such <h*>, get first <p> with match in <i>, <b>, <em>, <strong>
- If still none, get the first <p> with test string *at all*.
- (MAYBE: specify # of paragraphs to include or cut, before/after text?)



- (MAYBE: also embed images, YouTube/Vimeo?... iframe entire sites? like geogebra)
- (plugin in general? but then fail cross-site...)

- On hover, each header reveals two icon-buttons:
  one to permalink to that section, one to embed a Nutshell
- For all headers that start with a colon, ":header", HIDE IT
  and replace it with just an expandable button


 Exapndable (MAYBE: options)
