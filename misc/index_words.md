# : What is Nutshell?

**Nutshell** is a tool for putting "expandable explanations" in your blog or site, like this! They can even be [:recursive](#recursion).

Why do this? Well, if you explain something to me *in person*, I could say: "Wait, what's that word mean?", "May I have more detail?", or "Ooh, let's explore that tangent!" You can *adjust* your explanations to fit my confusion and curiosity. As wonderful as the written word is, readers can't tailor published writing in response to what they don't know, or want to know more of.

Well... unless you use Nutshell!

**Unlike links, Nutshell doesn't break your flow of reading**, and get you lost in a jungle of new tabs. Everything stays on one page. Even if an expanded explanation [:interrupts a sentence](#interruption), Nutshell will "recap" the sentence afterwards, so you always stay in context.

**Unlike [:Wikipedia's hover-to-preview](#Wikipedia'sHover), Nutshell works *across websites*.** You can embed explanations from *other authors*, and others can share your explanations in return. You can even embed stuff *written long before Nutshell even existed*, because Nutshell needs no special format – just good ol' headers & paragraphs! ([:example, from an ancient 2014 blog post](https://blog.ncase.me/explorable-explanations/#ProceduralRhetoric)) This way, you can re-use what you – and others – have written before. Standing on the shoulders of giants, etc etc.

**But wait, there's more! You can embed more than just text & pictures.** You can also embed – (click the following for examples) – playable interactives, YouTube clips, audio files, code/math snippets, even sections from Wikipedia, in any language, including Simple English Wikipedia!

Some people just want to watch the world learn.

If you're one of those – a blogger, an educator, a journalist, an activist, a technical writer, a code documenter, a math/science communicator – I hope this tool helps you help *your* learners.

Bite-sized, yet nutritious. Let's get cracking with Nutshell!

### : Recursion

**Recursion** is when something contains a version of itself – think of the film Inception's *dream-within-a-dream* plot, or a Russian nesting doll's *doll-within-a-doll* design.

Recursion is often used in math & programming, to get infinite potential out of finite stuff.

### : Wikipedia's Hover to Preview

On April 2018, Wikipedia got a cool new feature – if you hover over a link to another article, you see a page preview, like so:

This lets you quickly get info without losing context, and decide if you *really* want to click that link and sink into a 4-hour-long Wikipedia rabbithole.

Looks like fun? Good! Now, to install Nutshell, just paste this one line of code into your blog/site:

`code`

Then, as shown in the screenshot above, just write sections with headers & paragraphs as you normally would, then embed those sections with links. (but the link text needs a :colon in the front, so that Nutshell "knows" to make it expandable.)

# : Tips for writing Nutshells

Repeat after me: “Nutshell Is Not Wikipedia”.

[ALL IN UNISON]: *Nutshell Is Not Wikipedia.*

Look, I love Wikipedia, I give Jimmy my monies each month. But Wikipedia is optimized for "get all the info you'd ever want about this topic", *not* "learn about this topic for the first time".

And that's fine; no website can be everything for everyone. But Nutshell is meant for "learning stuff as you go", so, *Nutshell Is Not Wikipedia*. That means:

1. **You can have an actual tone of voice!** No need for Wikipedia's dry, professional style. Nutshell, like Wikipedia, will rely on community contributions, but unlike Wikipedia, you don't have to worry about overriding someone else's work. That's why Wikipedia enforces a unified tone, but that's not a problem for Nutshell – Nutshells from different authors *on the same topic* can live side-by-side.
2. **Use [:recursive](#recursion) Nutshells sparingly.** Wikipedia, being a reference site, has links for every other noun. For example, the first two links on the Wikipedia page for algebra are... "Arabic", and "bone-setting". But remember, the point of Nutshell is to make writing feel more like a conversation – so ask yourself: *if I were to explain X to someone in-person, is it likely they'd ask me a question about Y?* So, if I were explaining algebra, is it likely my listener would ask about bone-setting? No. But they *would* ask, "wait, what's a variable?", or "when would I need this in real life?", so *those* might be good candidates for recursive Nutshells.
3. **Explain the "theoretical minimum" needed for a reader to move on.** Wikipedia's responsibility is to be comprehensive. But your Nutshell may be embedded in *someone else's* writing, so your responsibility to *their* reader is to get in and get out. Explain the beautiful core idea in a nutshell (ayyy there's the title drop), then *leave.* Rough guideline: ideally 100 words or less, at most 500 words, put anything extra in separate Nutshells. (*This* Nutshell is 452 words long, oof.)

Finally, because Nutshell is new, and readers are used to worrying that clicking stuff will break their flow, you may want to introduce Nutshell to your readers. Just copy the following:

> By the way, if you see something [:like this](TODO), you can click it to "expand" it into an explanation, without breaking your reading flow. Try it out, click the above thing!

Then again, I'm not your mom. These are soft guidelines, not hard-coded rules. Do whatever you want, write an experimental non-linear hyperlinked novella, surprise me!

But if that blank canvas scares you, then my guidance is thus: Nutshells should be bite-sized, yet nutritious...

...and *not Wikipedia.*

### : How To Explain Complex Ideas

// pic

*(from xkcd)*

Explaining is making the unfamiliar, familiar. That's why it's *harder* for experts to explain accessibly: it's *all* familiar to them now. To counter this, here's two pieces of advice I keep in heart:

**💡 To create understanding: Show, *then* tell.** Start concrete, *then* go abstract. Use everyday examples, pictures, analogies, and familiar words... then *only afterwards*, give the abstractions, formulas, and jargon. 

**💖 To create motivation: Share what made *you* care.** Note I said "*what* made you care", not "*why* you care" – this forces you to be concrete: an interesting question, a cool use case, a personal connection... *what*, early on, made *you* care?

(other advice from 3Blue1Brown and Better Explained) //TODO

### : How To Write Concisely

The only "writing concisely" tip that ever worked for me:

1. Write your first draft.
2. Get a word count. (If your writing tool doesn't do word counts, use [wordcounter.net](https://wordcounter.net/))
3. Multiply that count by 0.9, to get 90% of it. *This is your new word count goal.*
4. *Cut down* your first draft to meet that goal.

This tough challenge forces you to *really* decide what's essential. Cut everything that's not.

# : What inspired this?

Once upon a time, in the 1960's, when the World Wide Web didn't yet exist, and folks *actually believed* that connecting the world's people would burst forth a new wellspring of empathy and enlightenment (ha ha ha *ha hA HA*)...

...in that era, Ted Nelson, inventor of hypertext, had a bunch of ideas, one of which was named **StretchText**. The idea was this: you write an article at a high-level narrative, and if your reader wants more detail, they can "zoom in" on a sentence to "stretch" it out into a few paragraphs. Then if they still want more detail, they can stretch the text *again*, for however many layers you wrote in. And *crucially*, the new text always stays in the context of one, continuous narrative – not a bunch of disjointed asides.

(See also, [:the original 1967 document](#StretchTextOriginalDocument), and Nelson [:showing it in a documentary](#doc))

When the World Wide Web was made in 1990, it only *partially* implemented Nelson's ideas. Your reader can click links for detail, but they'll lose context.

Since then, this idea's been re-discovered a few times. In 2008, a viral website named [Telescopic Text](https://www.telescopictext.org/text/KPx0nlXlKTciC) lets you stretch "I made tea" into a whole short story. In 2018, Wikipedia added a [:"hover to preview article"](#Wikipedia's Hover) feature.

And now, in 2022, I'm throwing my ring in the hat or whatever the phrase is, and giving you a new StretchText-like thing, named Nutshell!

p.s, [:why would I bother you with yet another implementation? (or: comparing Nutshell with previous StretchText-like tools)](#VsNutshell)

### : StretchText Vs Nutshell

Some Nutshell features, that I hope makes it nicer to use than previous StretchText-like tools:

1. **You don't have to write in a new format.** Most StretchText-like tools require typing in a new format; Nutshell just uses good ol' links, headers, and paragraphs, that you can write in whatever tool you like.
2. **You don't have to write all your explanations from scratch.** You can embed writing that you/others have written in the past, even from *before* Nutshell existed – which, again, is possible because Nutshell doesn't use a new format. (And vice versa: others can share & build upon *your* explanations, too!)
3. **You can embed more than just words & pictures:** playable interactives, audio, video, code, math, and even the article introductions from Wikipedia & Simple Wikipedia.

One reason for all these features, is because Nutshell has a [:network effect](#NetworkEffect) problem – its value depends on how many sites have Nutshell installed, but in the beginning very few sites will. So, I'm trying to get around this problem by making Nutshell as valuable as possible for you *even if nobody else uses Nutshell yet*. That's why I added the ability to re-use your own writing from before Nutshell existed, piggyback on Simple Wikipedia's explanations, and so on.

### : Network Effect

Let's say you're making [a dating site for people named Vanessa](TODO).

Vanessas will only sign up for your site if it's valuable, but alas, your site's only valuable if lots of Vanessas have already signed up!

Most in-person and virtual communities, marketplace platforms, and some technologies like phones and the internet, are like that: *how valuable it is depends on how many people are already there.* In economics, this is called a **network effect**.

On the upside, this means you can get a virtuous cycle: more people means more valuable, more valuable means more people! But on the downside, this means it's hard to get started: you first need some high **critical mass** to get that virtuous cycle rolling.

(And it's worse for users: if a product starts sucking, it's hard to escape. For example, even if most users feel *ugh* about Facebook, there's nowhere else to go – the only place that has the valuable network of Facebook, is Facebook.)

Some ways to escape the network trap:

1. To achieve critical mass quickly, give your thing away at a discount, for free, or even *pay* people to sign up. (Example: sign-up referral bonuses)
2. To lower critical mass needed, start with a tiny niche. (Example: Facebook was originally targeted for *just* Harvard students.)
3. Make the thing valuable *even if nobody else uses it.* (Example: early OKCupid had silly personality tests & quizzes.)
4. For users: use "open" platforms, to not get trapped in the first place. (Example: [:Mastodon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)) is an open alternative to Twitter. People can run their own Mastodon servers, and if you get sick of one, you can switch servers *but still access the same valuable networks*.)
5. Nerdy economics solution: use a "collective threshold pledge", where people pledge to join *if and only if* enough other people do the same. (Kickstarter does this for project funding... but I can't think of any famous examples of threshold-pledging for, say, activist action, leaving Facebook & Twitter, or joining the world's first Vanessa-only dating site.)


# : Who made this?

Nutshell was started by [:Nicky Case](#NickyCase) in 2020, who then procrastinated on it for two years, before finally rewriting all of it from scratch within two weeks on April 2022.

Nutshell is [:open source](#OpenSource), with full code [on Github](TODO). (see link for more code credits)

The special-est of thanks goes to:

* ss, ss, ss, ss for beta-testing this
* Kaira Imer for writing code on an earlier version
* //// for inspiring the "dots opening & closing" animation.

Nicky <strike>panhandles on the internet</strike> was funded by these generous folks on Patreon:

### : Open Source

**Open source** code is (*usually but not always\**) code that's free to use, remix & re-distribute – even for profit, with no or few\** requirements.

\* "Free" is an annoyingly confusing word. *Very roughly speaking,* think "free as in freedom of the press", not necessarily "free as in Wi-Fi at Starbucks."

\** One common requirement is "give credit". Fair enough. Some open source licenses go further: they require that your remix *also* be published under the same license. These are called **copyleft** licenses. Licenses without that requirement are called **permissive** licenses.
