<h1 id="toc_0">: What is Nutshell?</h1>

<p><strong>Nutshell</strong> is a tool for putting &quot;expandable explanations&quot; in your blog or site, like this! They can even be <a href="#recursion">:recursive</a>.</p>

<p>Why do this? Well, if you explain something to me <em>in person</em>, I could say: &quot;Wait, what&#39;s that word mean?&quot;, &quot;May I have more detail?&quot;, or &quot;Ooh, let&#39;s explore that tangent!&quot; You can <em>adjust</em> your explanations to fit my confusion and curiosity. As wonderful as the written word is, readers can&#39;t tailor published writing in response to what they don&#39;t know, or want to know more of.</p>

<p>Well... unless you use Nutshell!</p>

<p><strong>Unlike links, Nutshell doesn&#39;t break your flow of reading</strong>, and get you lost in a jungle of new tabs. Everything stays on one page. Even if an expanded explanation <a href="#interruption">:interrupts a sentence</a>, Nutshell will &quot;recap&quot; the sentence afterwards, so you always stay in context.</p>

<p><strong>Unlike <a href="#Wikipedia&#x27;sHover">:Wikipedia&#39;s hover-to-preview</a>, Nutshell works <em>across websites</em>.</strong> You can embed explanations from <em>other authors</em>, and others can share your explanations in return. You can even embed stuff <em>written long before Nutshell even existed</em>, because Nutshell needs no special format ‚Äì just good ol&#39; headers &amp; paragraphs! (<a href="TODO">:example, from a 2014 blog post</a>) This way, you can re-use what you ‚Äì and others ‚Äì have written before. Standing on the shoulders of giants, etc etc.</p>

<p><strong>But wait, there&#39;s more! You can embed more than just text &amp; pictures.</strong> You can also embed ‚Äì (click the following for examples) ‚Äì playable interactives, YouTube clips, audio files, code/math snippets, even sections from Wikipedia and Simple Wikipedia!</p>

<p>Some people just want to watch the world learn.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re one of those ‚Äì a blogger, an educator, a journalist, an activist, a technical writer, a code documenter, a math/science communicator ‚Äì I hope this tool helps you help <em>your</em> learners.</p>

<p>Bite-sized, yet nutritious. Let&#39;s get cracking with Nutshell!</p>

<h3 id="toc_1">: Recursion</h3>

<p><strong>Recursion</strong> is when something contains a version of itself ‚Äì think of the film Inception&#39;s <em>dream-within-a-dream</em> plot, or a Russian nesting doll&#39;s <em>doll-within-a-doll</em> design.</p>

<p>Recursion is often used in math &amp; programming, to get infinite potential out of finite stuff.</p>

<h3 id="toc_3">: Wikipedia&#39;s Hover to Preview</h3>

<p>On April 2018, Wikipedia got a cool new feature ‚Äì if you hover over a link to another article, you see a page preview, like so:</p>

<p>// pic</p>

<p>This lets you quickly get info without losing context, and decide if you <em>really</em> want to click that link and sink into a 4-hour-long Wikipedia rabbithole.</p>

<h1 id="toc_4">: How do I use Nutshell?</h1>

<p>First, check out...</p>

<p>Looks like fun? Good! Now, to install Nutshell, just paste this one line of code into your blog/site:</p>

<p><code>code</code></p>

<p>Then, as shown in the screenshot above, just write sections with headers &amp; paragraphs as you normally would, then embed those sections with links. (but the link text needs a :colon in the front, so that Nutshell &quot;knows&quot; to make it expandable.)</p>

<h1 id="toc_5">: Tips for writing Nutshells</h1>

<p>Repeat after me: ‚ÄúNutshell Is Not Wikipedia‚Äù.</p>

<p>[ALL IN UNISON]: <em>Nutshell Is Not Wikipedia.</em></p>

<p>Look, I love Wikipedia, I give Jimmy my monies each month. But Wikipedia is optimized for &quot;get all the info you&#39;d ever want about this topic&quot;, <em>not</em> &quot;learn about this topic for the first time&quot;.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s fine; no website can be everything for everyone. But Nutshell is meant for &quot;learning stuff as you go&quot;, so, <em>Nutshell Is Not Wikipedia</em>. That means:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>You can have an actual tone of voice!</strong> No need for Wikipedia&#39;s dry, professional style. Nutshell, like Wikipedia, will rely on community contributions, but unlike Wikipedia, you don&#39;t have to worry about overriding someone else&#39;s work. That&#39;s why Wikipedia enforces a unified tone, but that&#39;s not a problem for Nutshell ‚Äì Nutshells from different authors <em>on the same topic</em> can live side-by-side.</li>
<li><strong>Use <a href="#recursion">:recursive</a> Nutshells sparingly.</strong> Wikipedia, being a reference site, has links for every other noun. For example, the first two links on the Wikipedia page for algebra are... &quot;Arabic&quot;, and &quot;bone-setting&quot;. But remember, the point of Nutshell is to make writing feel more like a conversation ‚Äì so ask yourself: <em>if I were to explain X to someone in-person, is it likely they&#39;d ask me a question about Y?</em> So, if I were explaining algebra, is it likely my listener would ask about bone-setting? No. But they <em>would</em> ask, &quot;wait, what&#39;s a variable?&quot;, or &quot;when would I need this in real life?&quot;, so <em>those</em> might be good candidates for recursive Nutshells.</li>
<li><strong>Explain the &quot;theoretical minimum&quot; needed for a reader to move on.</strong> Wikipedia&#39;s responsibility is to be comprehensive. But your Nutshell may be embedded in <em>someone else&#39;s</em> writing, so your responsibility to <em>their</em> reader is to get in and get out. Explain the beautiful core idea in a nutshell (ayyy there&#39;s the title drop), then <em>leave.</em> Rough guideline: ideally 100 words or less, at most 500 words, put anything extra in separate Nutshells. (<em>This</em> Nutshell is 452 words long, oof.)</li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, because Nutshell is new, and readers are used to worrying that clicking stuff will break their flow, you may want to introduce Nutshell to your readers. Just copy the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By the way, if you see something <a href="TODO">:like this</a>, you can click it to &quot;expand&quot; it into an explanation, without breaking your reading flow. Try it out, click the above thing!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then again, I&#39;m not your mom. These are soft guidelines, not hard-coded rules. Do whatever you want, write an experimental non-linear hyperlinked novella, surprise me!</p>

<p>But if that blank canvas scares you, then my guidance is thus: Nutshells should be bite-sized, yet nutritious...</p>

<p>...and <em>not Wikipedia.</em></p>

<h3 id="toc_6">: How To Explain Complex Ideas</h3>

<p>// pic</p>

<p><em>(from xkcd)</em></p>

<p>Explaining is making the unfamiliar, familiar. That&#39;s why it&#39;s <em>harder</em> for experts to explain accessibly: it&#39;s <em>all</em> familiar to them now. To counter this, here&#39;s two pieces of advice I keep in heart:</p>

<p><strong>üí° To create understanding: Show, <em>then</em> tell.</strong> Start concrete, <em>then</em> go abstract. Use everyday examples, pictures, analogies, and familiar words... then <em>afterwards</em>, introduce the abstractions, formulas, and jargon. </p>

<p><strong>üíñ To create motivation: Share what made <em>you</em> care.</strong> Note I said &quot;<em>what</em> made you care&quot;, not &quot;<em>why</em> you care&quot; ‚Äì this forces you to be concrete: an interesting question, a cool use case, a personal connection... <em>what</em>, early on, made you care?</p>

<p>(other advice from 3Blue1Brown and Better Explained) //TODO</p>

<h3 id="toc_7">: How To Write Concisely</h3>

<ol>
<li>Write your first draft.</li>
<li>Get a word count. (If your writing tool doesn&#39;t do word counts for you, use <a href="https://wordcounter.net/">wordcounter.net</a>)</li>
<li>Multiply that number by 0.9, to get 90% of it. <em>This is your new word count goal.</em></li>
<li><em>Cut down</em> your first draft to meet that goal.</li>
</ol>

<p>This tough challenge forces you to <em>really</em> decide what&#39;s fluff or not. Then, cut that fluff.</p>

<h1 id="toc_8">: What inspired this?</h1>

<p>Once upon a time, in the 1960&#39;s, when the World Wide Web didn&#39;t yet exist, and folks <em>actually believed</em> that connecting the world&#39;s people would burst forth a new wellspring of empathy and enlightenment (ha ha ha <em>ha hA HA</em>)...</p>

<p>...in that era, Ted Nelson, inventor of hypertext, had a bunch of ideas, one of which was named <strong>StretchText</strong>. The idea was this: you write an article at a high-level narrative, and if your reader wants more detail, they can &quot;zoom in&quot; on a sentence to &quot;stretch&quot; it out into a few paragraphs. Then if they still want more detail, they can stretch the text <em>again</em>, for however many layers you wrote in. And <em>crucially</em>, the new text always stays in the context of one, continuous narrative ‚Äì not a bunch of disjointed asides.</p>

<p>(See also, <a href="#StretchTextOriginalDocument">:the original 1967 document</a>, and Nelson <a href="#doc">:showing it in a documentary</a>)</p>

<p>When the World Wide Web was made in 1990, it only <em>partially</em> implemented Nelson&#39;s ideas. Your reader can click links for detail, but they&#39;ll lose context.</p>

<p>Since then, this idea&#39;s been re-discovered a few times. In 2008, a viral website named <a href="https://www.telescopictext.org/text/KPx0nlXlKTciC">Telescopic Text</a> lets you stretch &quot;I made tea&quot; into a whole short story. In 2018, Wikipedia added a <a href="#Wikipedia&#x27;s%20Hover">:&quot;hover to preview article&quot;</a> feature.</p>

<p>And now, in 2022, I&#39;m throwing my ring in the hat or whatever the phrase is, and giving you a new StretchText-like thing, named Nutshell!</p>

<p>p.s, <a href="#VsNutshell">:why would I bother you with yet another implementation? (or: comparing Nutshell with previous StretchText-like tools)</a></p>

<h3 id="toc_9">: StretchText Original Document</h3>

<h3 id="toc_10">: StretchText Vs Nutshell</h3>

<p>Some Nutshell features, that I hope makes it nicer to use than previous StretchText-like tools:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>You don&#39;t have to write in a new format.</strong> Most StretchText-like tools require typing in a new format; Nutshell just uses good ol&#39; links, headers, and paragraphs, that you can write in whatever tool you like.</li>
<li><strong>You don&#39;t have to write all your explanations from scratch.</strong> You can embed writing that you/others have written in the past, even from <em>before</em> Nutshell existed ‚Äì which, again, is possible because Nutshell doesn&#39;t use a new format. (And vice versa: others can share &amp; build upon <em>your</em> explanations, too!)</li>
<li><strong>You can embed more than just words &amp; pictures:</strong> playable interactives, audio, video, code, math, and even the article introductions from Wikipedia &amp; Simple Wikipedia.</li>
</ol>

<p>One reason for all these features, is because Nutshell has a <a href="#NetworkEffect">:network effect</a> problem ‚Äì its value depends on how many sites have Nutshell installed, but in the beginning very few sites will. So, I&#39;m trying to get around this problem by making Nutshell as valuable as possible for you <em>even if nobody else uses Nutshell yet</em>. That&#39;s why I added the ability to re-use your own writing from before Nutshell existed, piggyback on Simple Wikipedia&#39;s explanations, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="toc_11">: Network Effect</h3>

<p>Let&#39;s say you&#39;re making <a href="TODO">a dating site for people named Vanessa</a>.</p>

<p>Vanessas will only sign up for your site if it&#39;s valuable, but alas, your site&#39;s only valuable if lots of Vanessas have already signed up!</p>

<p>Most in-person and virtual communities, marketplace platforms, and some technologies like phones and the internet, are like that: <em>how valuable it is depends on how many people are already there.</em> In economics, this is called a <strong>network effect</strong>.</p>

<p>On the upside, this means you can get a virtuous cycle: more people means more valuable, more valuable means more people! But on the downside, this means it&#39;s hard to get started: you first need some high <strong>critical mass</strong> to get that virtuous cycle rolling.</p>

<p>(And it&#39;s worse for users: if a product starts sucking, it&#39;s hard to escape. For example, even if most users feel <em>ugh</em> about Facebook, there&#39;s nowhere else to go ‚Äì the only place that has the valuable network of Facebook, is Facebook.)</p>

<p>A non-exhaustive list of ways to escape the network trap:</p>

<ol>
<li>To achieve critical mass quickly, give your thing away at a discount, for free, or even <em>pay</em> people to sign up. (Example: sign-up referral codes &amp; bonuses)</li>
<li>To lower critical mass needed, start by targeting a niche. (Example: Facebook was originally targeted for <em>just</em> Harvard students.)</li>
<li>Make the thing valuable <em>even if nobody else uses it.</em> (Example: early OKCupid had silly personality tests &amp; quizzes.)</li>
<li>For users: use &quot;open&quot; platforms, to not get trapped in the first place. (Example: Mastadon is an open alternative to Twitter. People can run their own Mastadon servers, and if you get sick of one, you can switch servers <em>but still access the same valuable networks</em>.)</li>
<li>Nerdy economics solution: use a &quot;collective threshold pledge&quot; where people pledge to join <em>if and only if</em> enough other people do the same. (Kickstarter does this for project funding... but I can&#39;t think of any famous examples of threshold-pledging for, say, activist action, leaving Facebook &amp; Twitter, or joining the world&#39;s first Vanessa-only dating site.)</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="toc_12">: Who made this?</h1>

<p>Nutshell was started by <a href="#NickyCase">:Nicky Case</a> in 2020, who then procrastinated on it for two years, before finally rewriting all of it from scratch within two weeks on April 2022.</p>

<p>Nutshell is <a href="#OpenSource">:open source</a>, with full code <a href="TODO">on Github</a>. (see link for more code credits)</p>

<p>The special-est of thanks goes to:</p>

<ul>
<li>ss, ss, ss, ss for beta-testing this</li>
<li>Kaira Imer for writing code on an earlier version</li>
<li>//// for inspiring the &quot;dots opening &amp; closing&quot; animation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nicky <strike>panhandles on the internet</strike> was funded by these generous folks on Patreon:</p>

<h3 id="toc_14">: Open Source</h3>

<p><strong>Open source</strong> code is (<em>usually but not always*</em>) code that&#39;s free to use, remix &amp; re-distribute ‚Äì even for profit, with no or few** requirements.</p>

<p>* &quot;Free&quot; is an annoyingly confusing word. <em>Very roughly speaking,</em> think &quot;free as in freedom of the press&quot;, not necessarily &quot;free as in Wi-Fi at Starbucks.&quot;</p>

<p>** One common requirement is &quot;give credit&quot;. Fair enough. Some open source licenses go further: they require that your remix <em>also</em> be published under the same license. These are called <strong>copyleft</strong> licenses. Licenses without that requirement are called <strong>permissive</strong> licenses.</p>
