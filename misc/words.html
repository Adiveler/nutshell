<h1 id="toc_0">: What is Nutshell?</h1>

<iframe width="750" height="300" src="indexpage/splash.html" data-splash="yes"></iframe>

<p><strong>Nutshell</strong> is a tool to help you make &quot;expandable explanations&quot;, like this one! They can even be <a href="#Recursion">:recursive</a>.</p>

<p>Why the heck did I make this? Well, I want to write about technical stuff... but I want it to remain accessible to everyone... but I don&#39;t want to have to <em>re-</em>explain stuff over and over... and using links suck.</p>

<p><em>Unlike links</em>, Nutshell lets you only include the snippet you need, not the whole page. Moreover, instead of being lost in a jungle of new tabs, your reader stays on the same page, not losing the flow of reading. Even if you <a href="#Interruption">:interrupt a sentence</a>, an &quot;expanded explanation&quot; recaps the sentence afterwards, so your reader never loses context.</p>

<p><em>Unlike <a href="#HoverToPreview">:Wikipedia&#39;s hover-to-preview-article</a>,</em> you can go multiple layers deep without losing flow. Not only that, you can re-use explanations <em>from other websites and authors, even stuff that was written long ago!</em> (For example, here&#39;s a snippet from <a href="todo">:my pretentious 2014 blog post</a>.) This works because Nutshell doesn&#39;t require you write in any new format, just the good ol&#39; headers &amp; paragraphs you&#39;re used to.</p>

<p><em>But wait, there&#39;s more!</em> It&#39;s not just text &amp; pictures you can embed! You can embed <a href="todo">:interactive stuff</a>, <a href="todo_billy_mays">:YouTube videos</a>, and â€“ hey, why not â€“ <a href="todo">:Wikipedia articles</a>. (That includes <a href="todo">:other languages</a> and <a href="todo">:Simple Wikipedia</a>, too!)</p>

<p>So if you&#39;re writing a blog, a news article, educational material, or code documentation... I hope Nutshell helps you help your readers, by giving them an option to learn just-in-time, always-in-context.</p>

<p>Bite-sized, yet nutritious. Let&#39;s get crackin&#39; with Nutshell!</p>

<h1 id="toc_1">: How do I use Nutshell?</h1>

<p>It&#39;s dead-parrot simple! Just copy-paste this one line anywhere on your website: (todo: which sites can do this? how?)</p>

<p>// src</p>

<p>Then, to embed a snippet from a web page, just make a link â€“ but put a :colon in front, so that Nutshell &quot;knows&quot; to convert it into an expandable explanation. Like so:</p>

<p>And that&#39;s all! Well, for the basics anyway. You can try out Nutshell for yourself online, and learn about more features, through my &quot;interactive-documentation-slash-demo&quot;:</p>

<h1 id="toc_2">: Tips on writing Nutshells</h1>

<p>If you&#39;d like to explain something in a nutshell (ayyyyy there&#39;s the title drop!), here&#39;s some advice:</p>

<ul>
<li>Show, <em>then</em> tell. Start with concrete examples &amp; pictures, <em>then</em> lay down the abstract definitions.</li>
<li>Write your first draft, then cut 10% of it. To do that: get a word count (for example, use <a href="todo">wordcounter.net</a>), multiply that by 0.9 to get your new target word count, then cut useless words until you meet your target.</li>
<li>This ain&#39;t Wikipedia. You can actually use your own voice, not Neutralese.</li>
<li>I know recursion is fun, but <em>do</em> show restraint, and <a href="#DontDoThis">:don&#39;t</a> <a href="#DontDoThis">:stuff</a> <a href="#DontDoThis">:your</a> <a href="#DontDoThis">:explanations</a> <a href="#DontDoThis">:with</a> <a href="#DontDoThis">:Nutshells</a> <a href="#DontDoThis">:like</a> <a href="#DontDoThis2">:this</a>. Only embed what&#39;s essential.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="toc_3">: What inspired this?</h1>

<p>Once upon a time, back when people actually believed that connecting the world&#39;s people would bring forth a new era of empathy and enlightenment (ha ha <em>ha hA HA HA<strong>AAAAA--</strong></em>)</p>

<p>...in that time, Ted Nelson, the inventor of hypertext, proposed something called <strong>StretchText</strong>. The idea was you have an article at a high-level narrative, but could &quot;stretch&quot; sentences into more detail. Then you stretch <em>that</em> detail into more detail, and so on, while everything stays in one continuous story â€“ not a jungle of new tabs.</p>

<p>(See <a href="#StretchTextOriginalDocument">:the original 1967 document for StretchText</a>, and Nelson <a href="#doc">:showing it in a documentary</a>)</p>

<p>Since then, this idea&#39;s been re-discovered a few times. In 2008, a viral website named <a href="https://www.telescopictext.org/text/KPx0nlXlKTciC">Telescopic Text</a> let you stretch &quot;I made tea&quot; into a whole short story. In 2018, Wikipedia added a <a href="#Wikipedia&#x27;s%20Hover">:&quot;hover to preview article&quot;</a> feature. (<a href="todo">:more &quot;prior art&quot; examples</a>)</p>

<p>And now, in 2022, I&#39;m giving you Nutshell! My main value-add, compared to previous StretchText-likes, is that you can embed snippets from <em>other websites &amp; authors, even stuff written long ago</em>. This way, we can build upon each others&#39; explanations, standing upon the shoulders of others who are standing upon the shoulders of others who are standing upon the shoulders of... and so on. </p>

<p>Maybe <em>that</em>&#39;ll bring about that new era of empathy and enlightenment!</p>

<h1 id="toc_4">: Who made this?</h1>

<p><a href="#NickyCase">:Nicky Case</a> is to blame for this thing. Also, this thing is <a href="#OpenSource">:open source</a>, with full code available <a href="TODO">on Github</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Special Thanks to</strong>: Ss, ss, ss, ss for beta-testing this. <a href="todo">Kaira Imer</a> for writing code on an earlier version. //// for inspiring the &quot;dots opening &amp; closing&quot; animation.</p>

<p>Nicky <strike>panhandles on the internet</strike> was funded by these kind folks via Patreon:</p>

<p>// iframe</p>

<p>If you&#39;d wanna help Nicky keep making free educational stuff and talk about themselves in the third person, you can dispose of your disposable cash <a href="https://www.patreon.com/ncase">on their Patreon!</a></p>

<p>But seriously, thank you to everyone above. It&#39;s been a rough few years and I appreciate y&#39;all.</p>

<h2 id="toc_5">: Recursion</h2>

<p><img src="indexpage/sprites/recursion.gif" data-float="left" width="200"/></p>

<p><strong>Recursion</strong> is when something contains a copy of itself. It&#39;s often used in math and programming, to get infinite potential out of finite stuff.</p>

<p>See also <a href="#recursion">:recursion</a>.</p>

<h2 id="toc_7">: Wikipedia&#39;s Hover To Preview</h2>

<p>This thing:</p>

<p>// gif</p>

<p>It only goes one level deep, and only previews 1 or 2 paragraphs, but it <em>is</em> helpful, and a large inspiration for this project.</p>

<p>Wikipedia is awesome, ok? Give Jimmy your money.</p>

<h2 id="toc_8">: Don&#39;t Do This</h2>

<p>don&#39;t do this.</p>

<h2 id="toc_9">: Don&#39;t Do This 2</h2>

<p>you <em>really</em> had to open all of these, didn&#39;t you?</p>

<h2 id="toc_10">: Nicky Case</h2>

<p>Nicky Case is an internet person who explains stuff with games, &quot;games&quot;, and pictures with words on them. You can see what they&#39;ve wrought upon humanity at <a href="https://ncase.me">ncase.me</a>.</p>

<h2 id="toc_11">: Open Source</h2>

<p><strong>Open source</strong> code is (<em>usually but not always*</em>) code that&#39;s free to use, remix &amp; re-distribute â€“ even for profit, with no or few** requirements.</p>

<p>* &quot;Free&quot; is an annoyingly confusing word. <em>Very roughly speaking,</em> think &quot;free as in freedom of the press&quot;, not necessarily &quot;free as in Wi-Fi at Starbucks.&quot;</p>

<p>** One common requirement is &quot;give credit&quot;. Fair enough. Some open source licenses go further: they require that your remix <em>also</em> be published under the same license. These are called <strong>copyleft</strong> licenses. Licenses without that requirement are called <strong>permissive</strong> licenses.</p>
