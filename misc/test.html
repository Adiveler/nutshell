<p>
    And now, for my first trick:
</p>
<p>
    Let's try to get stuff based on text found
    in <i>paragraphs</i>.
    Get: one paragraph to start,
    end where?
    paragraphs before or after or length.
</p>
<p>
    This is a story about <b>mechanism design</b>.
</p>
<p>
    Once upon a time there was nuclear war
    and so game theory was needed to understand
    this stupid-ass game.
</p>
<p>
    Later someone realized hey we actually <i>design</i>
    the games we're in, how about we
    make them less stupid of ass?
</p>
<p>
    And thus, mechanism design was born.

    (This is a filler paragraph.)
