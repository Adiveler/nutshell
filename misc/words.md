# : What is Nutshell?

<iframe width="750" height="300" src="indexpage/splash.html" data-splash="yes"></iframe>

**Nutshell** is a tool to help you make "expandable explanations", like this one! They can even be [:recursive](#Recursion).

Why the heck did I make this? Well, I want to write about technical stuff... but I want it to remain accessible to everyone... but I don't want to have to *re-*explain stuff over and over... and using links suck.

*Unlike links*, Nutshell lets you only include the snippet you need, not the whole page. Moreover, instead of being lost in a jungle of new tabs, your reader stays on the same page, not losing the flow of reading. Even if you [:interrupt a sentence](#Interruption), an "expanded explanation" recaps the sentence afterwards, so your reader never loses context.

*Unlike [:Wikipedia's hover-to-preview-article](#HoverToPreview),* you can go multiple layers deep without losing flow. Not only that, you can re-use explanations *from other websites and authors, even stuff that was written long ago!* (For example, here's a snippet from [:my pretentious 2014 blog post](todo).) This works because Nutshell doesn't require you write in any new format, just the good ol' headers & paragraphs you're used to.

*But wait, there's more!* It's not just text & pictures you can embed! You can embed [:interactive stuff](#InteractiveStuff), [:YouTube videos](todo_billy_mays), and â€“ hey, why not â€“ [:Wikipedia articles](todo). (That includes [:other languages](todo) and [:Simple Wikipedia](todo), too!)

So if you're writing a blog, a news article, educational material, or code documentation... I hope Nutshell helps you help your readers, by giving them an option to learn just-in-time, always-in-context.

Bite-sized, yet nutritious. Let's get crackin' with Nutshell!

# : How do I use Nutshell?

It's dead-parrot simple! Just copy-paste this one line anywhere on your website: (todo: which sites can do this? how?)

// src

Then, to embed a snippet from a web page, just make a link â€“ but put a :colon in front, so that Nutshell "knows" to convert it into an expandable explanation. Like so:

And that's all! Well, for the basics anyway. You can try out Nutshell for yourself online, and learn about more features, through my "interactive-documentation-slash-demo":

# : Tips on writing Nutshells

If you'd like to explain something in a nutshell (ayyyyy there's the title drop!), here's some advice:

* Show, *then* tell. Start with concrete examples & pictures, *then* lay down the abstract definitions.
* Write your first draft, then cut 10% of it. To do that: get a word count (for example, use [wordcounter.net](todo)), multiply that by 0.9 to get your new target word count, then cut useless words until you meet your target.
* This ain't Wikipedia. You can actually use your own voice, not Neutralese.
* I know recursion is fun, but *do* show restraint, and [:don't](#DontDoThis) [:stuff](#DontDoThis) [:your](#DontDoThis) [:explanations](#DontDoThis) [:with](#DontDoThis) [:Nutshells](#DontDoThis) [:like](#DontDoThis) [:this](#DontDoThis2). Only embed what's essential.

# : What inspired this?

Once upon a time, back when people actually believed that connecting the world's people would bring forth a new era of empathy and enlightenment (ha ha _ha hA HA HA**AAAAA--**_)

...in that time, Ted Nelson, the inventor of hypertext, proposed something called **StretchText**. The idea was you have an article at a high-level narrative, but could "stretch" sentences into more detail. Then you stretch *that* detail into more detail, and so on, while everything stays in one continuous story â€“ not a jungle of new tabs.

(See [:the original 1967 document for StretchText](#StretchTextOriginal), and Nelson [:showing it in a documentary](TODO))

Since then, this idea's been re-discovered a few times. In 2008, a viral website named [Telescopic Text](https://www.telescopictext.org/text/KPx0nlXlKTciC) let you stretch "I made tea" into a whole short story. In 2018, Wikipedia added a "hover to preview article" feature. ([:more "prior art" examples](#MoreStretchTextExamples))

And now, in 2022, I'm giving you Nutshell! My main value-add, compared to previous StretchText-likes, is that you can embed snippets from *other websites & authors, even stuff written long ago*. This way, we can build upon each others' explanations, standing upon the shoulders of others who are standing upon the shoulders of others who are standing upon the shoulders of... and so on. 

Hey, maybe *that'll* bring about that new era of empathy and enlightenment!

`NARRATOR: it didn't.`

# : Who made this?

[:Nicky Case](#NickyCase) is to blame for this thing. Also, this thing is [:open source](#OpenSource), with full code available [on Github](TODO).

**Special Thanks to**: Ss, ss, ss, ss for beta-testing this. [Kaira Imer](todo) for writing code on an earlier version. //// for inspiring the "dots opening & closing" animation.

Nicky <strike>panhandles on the internet</strike> was funded by these kind folks via Patreon:

But seriously, thank you to everyone above. It's been a rough few years and I appreciate y'all.

## : Recursion

<img src="indexpage/sprites/recursion.gif" data-float="left" width="200"/>

**Recursion** is when something contains a copy of itself. It's often used in math and programming, to get infinite potential out of finite stuff.

## : Wikipedia's Hover To Preview

This thing:

It only goes one level deep, and only previews 1 or 2 paragraphs, but it *is* helpful, and a large inspiration for this project.

Wikipedia is awesome, ok? Give Jimmy your money.

## : Don't Do This

don't do this.

## : Don't Do This 2

you just *had* to open all of these, didn't you?

## : Open Source

**Open source** code is (*usually but not always\**) code that's free to use, remix & re-distribute â€“ even for profit, with no or few\** requirements.

\* "Free" is an annoyingly confusing word. *Very roughly speaking,* think "free as in freedom of the press", not necessarily "free as in Wi-Fi at Starbucks."

\** One common requirement is "give credit". Fair enough. Some open source licenses go further: they require that your remix *also* be published under the same license. These are called **copyleft** licenses. Licenses without that requirement are called **permissive** licenses.
