    A bajillion years ago, Henry George said
    we should do a
    <a href="#LVT">:location value tax (LVT)</a>
    and
    <a href="#UBI">:unconditional basic income (UBI)</a>.
</p>

<h2>: Location Value Tax (LVT)</h2>

<p>
    Let's say you own an unused lot in downtown San Francisco.
    A <b>location value tax</b> (also known as a <b>land value tax</b>)
    would tax you based on how valuable the <i>location</i> is.
    <i>Importantly, it is NOT a tax on whatever improvements you put
        on the property.</i>
</p>

<p>
    This is to prevent speculators doing stuff like buying up an
    unused lot in downtown San Francisco, then hoarding it,
    waiting for the price to go way up before "flipping it",
    and selling it to some other sucker.
</p>

<h2>: Unconditional Basic Income (UBI)</h2>

<blockquote>
“Welcome to Alaska, here's a thousand dollars.”<br>
~ The Simpsons Movie
</blockquote>

<p>
    The idea of <b>basic income</b> is "just give every citizen some
    amount of money". (Whether that's per month, per year, or a lump-sum
    payment at some age, like 18 years old.)
</p>

<p>
    If there are some requirements in order to receive the basic income
    – for example, you have to be working or have kids –
    then that's a <b>conditional basic income (CBI)</b>.
    If there are no requirements, that's <b>unconditional basic income (UBI)</b>.
</p>

<h2>Recursion</h2>
