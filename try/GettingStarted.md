## To write a Nutshell section, start with a header...

...then put a bunch of words in a paragraph.

Or two.

(Bonus! On the right-hand side of this page, the "converted" section, you can hover over a header to see its "embed this Nutshell" button. Try it out!)

## Then, to embed a Nutshell...

Make a link, yo...

* with a :colon as the first character of the link text, so Nutshell knows to convert it.
* link to `SomeWebsite.com/SomePage#TextOfTheHeader`.

(If it's the same website, you can just link to `SomePage/#TextOfTheHeader`. If it's the same page, you can just link to `#TextOfTheHeader`. Also, capitalization/spaces/punctuation doesn't matter, and you don't need the entire text of the header: if the header is "Then, to embed a Nutshell..." you can just use `#EmbedANutshell`, `#embed-a-nutshell`, `#eMbED A NuT sHEll!!!!!`, etc)

Three examples:
* A :link-with-colon to a section from a different website. :What is RSS? (Note that you can embed writings from before Nutshell was made! This is because Nutshell needs no special format, just the headers & paragraphs you're used to.)
* A :link-with-colon to an above section from this page. :To write a Nutshell section...
* A :link-with-colon to this section itself. :To embed a Nutshell...


## (Try it yourself! Replace this header with whatever text you want...)

(Then write a :link-with-colon to #WhateverTextYouWant. Remember that :colon!)

(Finally, press "refresh" at the top-right of this page to see it live!)



## P.S: on embedding from other websites

If you're embedding Nutshells from within the same website, all's good. But if you're embedding from another website, it must either:

* Have Nutshell also installed on at least just the webpage you want,
if not the whole site. And/or,
* Have CORS enabled

Not sure if a webpage has Nutshell or CORS enabled? Just make a :link to it in this Try Nutshell page to test it! Here's the fail-message you get from :a link to something without Nutshell or CORS.

## P.S: first step last – to install Nutshell in your blog / site...

Just copy-paste this one line of code into your site, to include the script:

`<script src=""></script>`

Alternatively, download the script here (TODO) & include it manually yourself!

(Most blogging platforms – like Wordpress, Tumblr, Ghost, Github Pages, etc – allow you to add your own custom code. Sadly, some – like Medium – don't. Check your platform to see if you're even allowed to add *one* line of code!)
