## To write a Nutshell section, start with a header...

...then put a bunch of words in a paragraph.

Or two.

## Then, to embed a Nutshell...

Make a link...

* with a :colon as the first character of the link text,
  so Nutshell knows to convert it.
* link to SomeWebsite.com/SomePage#TextOfTheHeader.
    * If it's the same website, you can just link to SomePage/#TextOfTheHeader.
	* If it's the same page, you can just link to #TextOfTheHeader.
	* (You don't need to include the entire text of the header, just a portion!
	  Also capitalization, spaces, and punctuation don't matter.
      For example, if the header is "Then, to embed a Nutshell..."
      you can just use the tag #EmbedANutshell, or #embed-a-nutshell,
      or #eMbED A NuT sHEll!!!!!, etc)

Three examples:
1. :link-with-colon to a section from a different website. :What is RSS?
   (Note that you can embed writings from before Nutshell was made!
   This is because Nutshell needs no special format,
   just the headers & paragraphs you're used to.)
2. :link-with-colon to an above section from this page.
   :To write a Nutshell section...
3. :link-with-colon to this section itself. :To embed a Nutshell...

    mode: 'markdown'
});
