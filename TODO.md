(this is for my own personal records, plz ignore)

* a "unit test suite" page
	* with urls for querystring...
* the "sentence follow-up" feature is a bit messed
	* no need for "..." after "recursive."
   * ":YouTube videos" should have pre-sentence
* Wall of Thanks: fluid width
* Hidden messages for lack of JS (RSS, Pocket) etc fallback
