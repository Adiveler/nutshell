(this is for my own personal records, plz ignore)

* a "unit test suite" page
	* with urls for querystring...
* the "sentence follow-up" feature is a bit messed
	* no need for "..." after "recursive."
   * ":YouTube videos" should have pre-sentence

--------------------

OTHER NUTSHELL WHATEVERS
* double check words.md -> words.html -> index.html still works. (AND REMOVE 1.0.2)
* no nut on blog headings in ncase, what's the deal?
* confirm... new url for ?=
* FEATURES: Hidden messages for lack of JS (RSS, Pocket) etc fallback
* Promo/copy more highlight "EMBEDDABLE", too...
* "Learn More About"
