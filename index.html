<h2 id="toc_1">What is Nutshell?</h2>

<p><strong>Nutshell</strong> is a tool that lets you put &quot;expandable explanations&quot; in your blog or site, like this! You can even make these <a href="#recursion">:recursive</a>?! Hello my baby hello my ragtime gal.</p>

<p>If you explain something to me <em>in person</em>, I could say: &quot;Wait, I don&#39;t know what that word means&quot;, &quot;Could you give me more details?&quot;, &quot;Ooh, let&#39;s go off on that tangent!&quot; You can adjust your explanations according to my <em>confusion and curiosity.</em> As amazing as the written word is, you can&#39;t change published texts in response to what individual readers don&#39;t know, or want to know more of.</p>

<p>Well... unless you use Nutshell!</p>

<p>Unlike links, Nutshell doesn&#39;t break your flow of reading, or make you lose context, lost amidst a jungle of browser tabs. Everything is kept in one page, in the flow, in context.</p>

<p>Unlike Wikipedia&#39;s <a href="#Wikipedia&#x27;sHover">:hover-to-preview</a>, Nutshell can work <em>across websites</em>. You can embed explanations from <em>other authors</em>, and others can embed &amp; share your explanations in return. You can even embed stuff <em>written before Nutshell was made</em>, because Nutshell doesn&#39;t require a special format – just write with headers &amp; paragraphs as you normally do! (Example from a 2014 blog post) This way, you don&#39;t have to write all your &quot;expandable explanations&quot; from scratch every time: you can re-use what you wrote before, or what <em>others</em> have written before. Standing on the shoulders of giants, y&#39;know.</p>

<p>But wait, there&#39;s more! It&#39;s not just text &amp; images you can embed. You can even embed playable interactives, audio, YouTube clips, and – sure, why not – the introduction sections from Wikipedia and Simple Wikipedia. (click those for examples)</p>

<p>Some people just want to watch the world learn. If you&#39;re one of those – a blogger, an educator, a journalist, an activist, a technical writer, a code documenter, a math/science communicator – I hope this tool helps you help your learners.</p>

<p>Bite-sized, yet nutritious. Let&#39;s get cracking with Nutshell!</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">How do I use Nutshell?</h2>

<p>// video</p>

<p><strong>1) Paste this one line of code into your blog / site:</strong></p>

<p><code>code</code></p>

<p>(or: <a href="TODO">download code directly</a>)</p>

<p><strong>2) Write headers &amp; paragraphs as you normally would.</strong></p>

<p><strong>3) Write links as you normally would, but put a :colon in front</strong>, so Nutshell knows to convert that into an &quot;expandable&quot; thing.</p>

<p>(note, <a href="#caveats">:two important caveats</a>)</p>

<p>If you&#39;d like to try Nutshell online before going through all the hassle of pasting one line of code, here&#39;s the ✨ <strong><a href="TODO">Try Nutshell online demo</a></strong>! ✨</p>

<p>Nutshell is forever free &amp; <a href="#OpenSource">:open-source</a>. You can download &amp; remix my code <a href="TODO">from Github</a>.</p>

<h2 id="toc_3">Tips for writing Nutshells</h2>

<p>Repeat after me: “Nutshell Is Not Wikipedia”.</p>

<p>[ALL IN UNISON]: <em>Nutshell Is Not Wikipedia.</em></p>

<p>Look, I love Wikipedia, it&#39;s a fantastic reference, I give Jimmy my monies each month. But Wikipedia is optimized for &quot;get all the info you&#39;d ever want about this topic&quot;, <em>not</em> &quot;learning about this topic as a total beginner&quot;.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s fine; no website can be everything for everyone. But Nutshell is meant for &quot;learning stuff as you go&quot;, so, again, <em>Nutshell Is Not Wikipedia</em>. That means:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>You can have an actual tone of voice!</strong> No need for the dry, professional style of Wikipedia. Nutshell, like Wikipedia, will rely on community contributions, but unlike Wikipedia, you don&#39;t have to worry about overriding someone else&#39;s work. That&#39;s why Wikipedia enforces a unified tone, but it&#39;s not a problem with Nutshell – Nutshells from different authors <em>on the same topic</em> can live side-by-side.</li>
<li><strong>Use <a href="#recursion">:recursive</a> Nutshells sparingly.</strong> Wikipedia, being a reference site, needs to put links for every noun. For example, the first two links on the Wikipedia page for algebra are... &quot;Arabic&quot;, and &quot;bone-setting&quot;. The point of Nutshell is to make published writing more like a person-to-person conversation – so, before you write a Nutshell about X, and embed a Nutshell about Y, ask yourself: <em>if I were to explain X to someone in-person, is it likely they&#39;d ask me a question about Y?</em> So, if I were explaining algebra, it&#39;s unlikely my listener would ask about bone-setting. But they <em>would</em> ask, &quot;wait, what&#39;s a variable?&quot;, or, &quot;when would I need this in real life?&quot; – so <em>those</em> might be good candidates for recursive Nutshells.</li>
<li><strong>Explain the &quot;theoretical minimum&quot; needed for a reader to move on.</strong> Wikipedia&#39;s goal is to be comprehensive. That is not your goal. Your Nutshell may be embedded in <em>someone else&#39;s</em> essay, so your responsibility to <em>their</em> reader is to get in and get out. Explain the beautiful core idea, maybe one or two recursive Nutshells for pre-requisite ideas &amp; follow-up details, then <em>leave.</em> (Guideline: ideally 100 words or less, at <em>most</em> 500 words. <em>This</em> Nutshell is /// words, whoof.)</li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, because Nutshell is new, and readers worry that clicking stuff will break their flow, you may want to introduce Nutshell to your readers. Just copy-paste the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By the way, if you see something <a href="TODO">:like this</a>, you can click it to &quot;expand&quot; it into an explanation, without breaking your flow of reading. Try it out, click the above thing!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Other than that, all the usual explaining-advice applies: start with concrete examples, pictures, analogies, curious problems, and familiar words... then only <em>after</em> that, introduce the abstractions, formulas, and technical jargon. (External links: advice from <a href="TODO">Better Explained</a> and <a href="TODO">3Blue1Brown</a>)</p>

<p>Then again, I&#39;m not the leather-clad Swede you hired, I can&#39;t boss you around. Do whatever you want, write an experimental non-linear hyperlinked novella, surprise me!</p>

<p>But if that blank canvas scares you, then my guidance is: Nutshells should be bite-sized, yet nutritious...</p>

<p>...and <em>is not Wikipedia.</em></p>

<h2 id="toc_4">What inspired this?</h2>

<p><em>Time for a history lesson, kiddos.</em></p>

<p>Once upon a time, in the 1960&#39;s, when the World Wide Web didn&#39;t exist yet, and folks <em>actually believed</em> that connecting the world&#39;s people would burst forth a new wellspring of democracy, empathy, and enlightenment (ha ha ha <em>ha hA HA</em>)...</p>

<p>...in that era, Ted Nelson, inventor of hypertext, had a bunch of ideas, one of which was named <strong>StretchText</strong>. The idea was this: you write an article at a high-level narrative, and if your reader wants more detail on a particular sentence, they can &quot;zoom in&quot;, and <em>stretch</em> that sentence into more detailed paragraphs. Then, if they still want more detail, they can stretch it <em>again</em>, for however many layers you wrote in. But <em>crucially</em>, the new text would always stay in the context of one, continuous narrative – not a bunch of disjointed asides.</p>

<p>(Bonus: <a href="#StretchTextOriginalDocument">:picture of the original 1967 StretchText document</a>!)</p>

<p>When the World Wide Web was made in 1990, it <em>partially</em> implemented Nelson&#39;s ideas. You <em>can</em> give your reader links to click if they want more detail, but they will lose context.</p>

<p>In the decades since, the idea&#39;s been re-discovered a few times. Here&#39;s a not-comprehensive list...</p>

<ul>
<li>2006: <a href="https://natematias.com/stretchtext/">The first tool</a> to make StretchText-like things for the Web (as far as I know)</li>
<li>2008: A viral website named <a href="https://www.telescopictext.org/text/KPx0nlXlKTciC">Telescopic Text</a> lets you stretch &quot;I made tea&quot; into a whole short story.</li>
<li>2018: Wikipedia adds a <a href="#Wikipedia&#x27;s%20Hover">:&quot;hover to preview article&quot;</a> feature.</li>
</ul>

<p>And now, in 2022, I&#39;m throwing my ring in the hat or whatever the phrase is, and giving you a new StretchText-like thing named Nutshell.</p>

<p>Further Reading: <a href="#VsNutshell">:Why would I bother you with yet another implementation? (or: comparing &amp; contrasting Nutshell with previous StretchText-like tools)</a></p>

<h2 id="toc_5">Who made this?</h2>

<p>Nutshell was a project started by <a href="http://localhost:8082/#NickyCase">:Nicky Case</a> in 2020, who then procrastinated on-and-off on it for two years, before finally rewriting all of it from scratch in two weeks in April 2022.</p>

<p>Special Thanks is also owed to these peeps:</p>

<ul>
<li>ss, ss, ss, ss for beta-testing early versions of Nutshell</li>
<li>Kaira Imer for doing code on a previous version</li>
<li>//// for remixing the beta version of Nutshell, and inspiring the new &quot;dots opening &amp; closing&quot; animation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nicky <span style="text-decoration:line-through">panhandles on the internet</span> was funded by these generous folks via Patreon:</p>

<p>But seriously, thank you to everyone mentioned above. It&#39;s been a rough few years and I appreciate y&#39;all.</p>

<h3 id="toc_6">: Recursion</h3>

<p><strong>Recursion</strong> is when something contains a version of itself – for example, think of the film Inception&#39;s <em>dream-within-a-dream</em> plot device, or a Russian nesting doll&#39;s <em>doll-within-a-doll</em> design.</p>

<p>Recursion is most often used in math &amp; programming, to get infinite potential out of finite stuff.</p>

<h3 id="toc_8">: Wikipedia&#39;s Hover to Preview</h3>

<p>On April 2018, Wikipedia got a cool new feature – if you hover over a link to another article, you see a page preview, like so:</p>

<p>// pic</p>

<p>This way you can quickly get info without losing context, and decide if you <em>really</em> want to click that link and sink into a 4-hour-long Wikipedia rabbithole.</p>

<h3 id="toc_10">: StretchText Vs Nutshell</h3>

<p>There&#39;s a couple features I&#39;ve added that, hopefully, will make Nusthell easier to use than previous StretchText-like tools:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>You don&#39;t have to write in a new format.</strong> Most StretchText-like tools usually need you to type in some new format; Nutshell just uses good ol&#39; links, headers, and paragraphs, that you can write in whatever tool you&#39;re already used to.</li>
<li><strong>You don&#39;t have to write all your explanations from scratch every time.</strong> You can embed explanations you&#39;ve already written in the past, even from <em>before</em> Nutshell was made – which, again, is possible because Nutshell doesn&#39;t use a new format. What&#39;s more, you can embed explanations that <em>others</em> have written before, and vice versa: others can share the explanations <em>you&#39;ve</em> written in their writing. Something something collective intelligence. </li>
<li><strong>You can embed more than just words &amp; pictures.</strong> You can also embed playable interactives, audio, video, and – eh, why not – the article introductions from Wikipedia &amp; Simple Wikipedia. (Actually, there&#39;s a strong reason for this: the value of Nutshell depends on how many websites have Nutshell installed, but in the beginning there will be few of those. So, Nutshell has a <a href="#NetworkEffect">:network effect</a> problem. So, I&#39;m trying to solve this by making Nutshell as valuable as possible for you <em>even if nobody else is using Nutshell yet</em>. So, that&#39;s why I added the ability to re-use your own old explanations, and piggyback on Wikipedia&#39;s.)</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="toc_11">: Network Effect</h3>

<p>Let&#39;s say you&#39;re making <a href="TODO">a dating site for people named Vanessa</a>.</p>

<p>Vanessas will only sign up for your site if it&#39;s valuable, but alas, your site&#39;s only valuable if lots of Vanessas have already signed up!</p>

<p>Most in-person and virtual communities, marketplaces offline and on, as well as some technologies like phones and the internet, are like this: <em>how valuable it is depends on how many people are already using it.</em> In economics, this is called a <strong>network effect</strong>.</p>

<p>On the upside, this means you can get a virtuous cycle: more people means more valuable, more valuable means more people! But on the downside, this means it&#39;s hard to even get started: you first need some (usually high) <strong>critical mass</strong> to get that virtuous cycle rolling.</p>

<p>(And worse for users, this means that if a product starts sucking, it&#39;s hard to escape. For example: even if most people feel bleerggghrggrhghh about Facebook &amp; Twitter, there&#39;s nowhere else to go – the only place that has the valuable network of Facebook &amp; Twitter are Facebook &amp; Twitter. What&#39;re ya gonna do, hang out with a buncha <em>nerds</em> on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(software)">:Mastadon</a>?)</p>

<p>Some ways to escape the network trap:</p>

<ol>
<li>To achieve critical mass as soon as possible, give your thing away at a discount, for free, or even <em>pay</em> people to sign up. (Example: sign-up referral codes &amp; bonuses)</li>
<li>Make the thing valuable <em>even if nobody else uses it.</em> (Example: early OKCupid had silly personality tests &amp; quizzes.)</li>
<li>Have some kind of &quot;collective threshold pledge&quot; where people pledge to join <em>if and only if</em> enough other people do the same. (Sort-of-example: Kickstarter does this for project funding, but I can&#39;t think of any <em>famous</em> examples of threshold-pledging for, say, activist action, or leaving Facebook &amp; Twitter, or joining the world&#39;s first Vanessa-only dating site.)</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="toc_12">: Open Source</h3>

<p><strong>Open source</strong> code is – <em>usually</em>* – code that&#39;s not only free to use, but also free to build upon, remix &amp; re-distribute, even for profit, with no or few** requirements.</p>

<p>* There are annoying debates &amp; confusions about the words &quot;free&quot; and &quot;open&quot;. <em>Very roughly speaking,</em> think &quot;free as in freedom of the press&quot;, not &quot;free as in free Wi-Fi at Starbucks.&quot;</p>

<p>** One common requirement is &quot;give credit&quot;. Fair enough. Some open source licenses go further: they require that your remix <em>also</em> be published under the same license. These are called <strong>copyleft</strong> licenses. Licenses without that requirement are called <strong>permissive</strong> licenses.</p>

<h3 id="toc_13">: CORS</h3>

<p><strong>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)</strong> are a bunch of rules that exist because web security programmers are paranoid, and rightfully so.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say you&#39;re visiting Facebook.com. Your web browser (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Microsoft Edge, etc...) pings Facebook, and Facebook gives you back your personal information. So far so good.</p>

<p>But now let&#39;s say you&#39;re visiting TotallyNotCyberCriminals.com. <em>If it weren&#39;t for CORS rules, this could happen:</em> the malicious website makes your web browser ping Facebook, Facebook sends back your personal information, and <em>bam</em> the bad actors have your personal information. (Well, different bad actors.)</p>

<p>Web browsers <em>could</em> just decide, &quot;ok, a site can only get info from itself, only Facebook can get info from Facebook, etc&quot;. But then that&#39;ll make it impossible to do cool web things, like, say, make an &quot;expandable explanations&quot; tool that can embed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet_door">:random info from Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>So the people who make web browsers chose this solution: Website X can only get information from Website Y <em>if Website Y says Website X is allowed to have it.</em> So Facebook says, nope, only me (and my advertising partners) can get your personal info, while Wikipedia says &quot;hey yeah free (non-personal) info for everybody!&quot;</p>

<p>So, it&#39;s rules for sharing resources across different websites, different origins. Hence: &quot;Cross-Origin Resource Sharing&quot;.</p>

<p>P.S: <a href="#CORS%20For%20Web%20Developers">:a message for web developers</a></p>

<h3 id="toc_14">: CORS For Web Developers</h3>

<p>If you&#39;re a web developer, and it&#39;s safe for you to do so, I recommend enabling CORS on your website. You can do this for free by migrating to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> – I promise this message was not sponsored – or, <a href="https://enable-cors.org/">check out Enable-CORS.org for more resources</a>.</p>

<p>And, look! Because Enable-CORS.org has enabled CORS, even <em>without</em> them having installed this &quot;expandable explanations&quot; tool, I can still embed <a href="https://enable-cors.org/#Why">:info from them</a>. Nice. 👌</p>

<h3 id="toc_15">: Caveats For Trying To Use Nutshell</h3>

<p>Two important caveats when trying to use Nutshell:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You only need to paste in <em>one</em> line of code into the site, but sadly some blogging platforms don&#39;t let you paste <em>any</em> custom code. You <em>can</em> successfully do this with Wordpress, Tumblr, Ghost, and Github Pages... but sadly, not Medium. First check if <em>your</em> blogging platform allows any custom code.</p></li>
<li><p>If you&#39;re <a href='#'>embedding</a> <b>an</b> <i>explanation</i> from someone else&#39;s website, the other site either needs Nutshell installed, or needs something called <a href="#CORS">:&quot;CORS&quot;</a> enabled. But thankfully, you can use the <em><a href="TODO">Try Nutshell</a></em> tool to test links first!</p></li>
</ol>
