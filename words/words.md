# : What is Nutshell?

<iframe width="750" height="300" src="indexpage/splash.html" data-splash="yes"></iframe>

**Nutshell** is a tool to make "expandable explanations", like this! They can even be [:recursive](#Recursion). This lets your readers learn only the details they need, just-in-time, always-in-context.

Unlike links, Nutshell lets you include only the snippet you need, not the whole page. Plus, instead of being lost in a jungle of new tabs, your reader stays on one page, keeping their flow of reading. Even if you [:interrupt a sentence](#Interruption), Nutshell recaps the sentence afterwards, so your reader never loses context.

Unlike [:Wikipedia's "Hover to Preview Article" feature](#HoverToPreview), **you can re-use explanations from other websites and authors, _even stuff that was written long ago!_** (Example: a snippet from [:my pretentious 2014 blog post](https://blog.ncase.me/explorable-explanations/#ProceduralRhetoric).) This works because Nutshell doesn't require writing in a new format â€“ just the good ol' headers, paragraphs, and links you're used to.

*But wait, there's more!* It's not just text & pictures you can embed! You can also embed [:interactive playthings](indexpage/malicious.html#InteractivePlay), [:YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_RLYSaPvak), and â€“ hey, why not â€“ [:Wikipedia articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catgirl). (That includes [:other languages](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baguette_(pain)) and [:Simple Wikipedia](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe), too!)

So: if you're writing a blog, a news article, a glossary, educational material, or code documentation... I hope Nutshell helps you help _your_ readers.

Bite-sized, yet nutritious. Let's get crackin' with Nutshell!

# : How do I use Nutshell?

It's dead-parrot simple! Just copy-paste this *one line* onto your site: ([how-to details](#HowToIncludeNutshell))

<iframe src='indexpage/include_nutshell.html?full' width='700' height='20'></iframe>

Then, to write a Nutshell snippet, just use headers & paragraphs. And to embed a snippet, just make a link, but with a <span data-fake-link>:colon</span> in the link text, so that Nutshell knows to convert it. Like this:

# : Tips on writing Nutshells

If you'd like to explain something in a nutshell (ayyyyy title drop), here's some advice:

* Show, *then* tell. Start with concrete examples & pictures, *then* lay down the abstract definitions.
* Write your first draft, get a word count (e.g. use [wordcounter.net](https://wordcounter.net/)), then cut 10% of your words.
* This ain't Wikipedia. Use your own voice, not Neutralese.
* I know recursion is fun, but *do* show restraint. [:Don't](#DontDoThis) [:stuff](#DontDoThis) [:your](#DontDoThis) [:explanations](#DontDoThis) [:with](#DontDoThis) [:Nutshells](#DontDoThis) [:like](#DontDoThis) [:this](#DontDoThis2). Embed only what's essential.

For more advice, see [:3Blue1Brown on making math explainers](https://youtu.be/ojjzXyQCzso?t=512), my [:Stanford mini-talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-M2U3Jl1Cg#with_summary), or [:my FAQ](https://ncase.me/faq/#writing_accessible_explanations)

# : What inspired this?

Once upon a time, back when folks believed connecting the world's people would birth a new era of empathy and enlightenment (ha ha h*a hA HA HAAAAA--*)

...in that time, the inventor Ted Nelson proposed something called **StretchText**. The idea was this: you're reading an article at a high-level, but can "stretch" sentences into more detail. Then you can stretch *that* detail into more detail, and so on, while everything stays in one continuous context.

(See [:its original 1967 design document](#StretchTextOriginal), and Nelson [:showing it off in a Werner Herzog documentary](https://youtu.be/Bqx6li5dbEY?t=150))

Since then, the idea's been re-discovered a few times. In 2008, a viral website named [Telescopic Text](https://www.telescopictext.org/text/KPx0nlXlKTciC) let you stretch "I made tea" into a short story. In 2018, Wikipedia added a "hover to preview article" feature. ([:more StretchText-likes](#MoreStretchTextExamples))

And now, in 2022, I give you Nutshell! My main value-add, compared to previous StretchText-likes, is that you can embed snippets from *other websites & authors, even stuff written long ago*. That way, we can build upon each others' explanations.

Hey, maybe *that'll* birth that new era of empathy and enlightenment!

`NARRATOR: it didn't.`

# : Who made this?

[:Nicky Case](#NickyCase) is to blame for this thing. This thing is [:open source](#OpenSource), all code available [on Github](https://github.com/ncase/nutshell).

**Special Thanks to**: Andy Matuschak, DominoPivot, Mike Cook, NachoBIT for gifting early feedback; [Kaira Imer](https://github.com/spaciecat) for writing code on an previous version; [Amber Thomas](https://twitter.com/ProQuesAsker/status/1440125223685165061) for inspiring the "dots opening & closing" animation.

## : Recursion

<img src="indexpage/sprites/recursion.gif" data-float="left" width="200"/>

**Recursion** is when something contains a copy of itself. It's often used in math and programming, to get infinite potential out of finite stuff.

See also [:recursion](#recursion).

## : Interruption

## : Wikipedia's Hover To Preview

This thing:

![](indexpage/wiki.gif "a GIF showing Wiki's hover-to-preview feature; when a cursor hovers over a link, a preview of the article shows up in a bubble")

It only goes one level deep & only previews a few paragraphs, but it *is* helpful, and an inspiration for Nutshell.

Wikipedia is cool, ok? Give Jimmy your money.

## : How To Include Nutshell

If you use [WordPress](todo-tut), [Tumblr](todo-tut), [GitHub Pages](todo-tut), or can otherwise change your site's [:HTML](#HTML), just paste this code anywhere, preferably the <head>:

<iframe src='indexpage/include_nutshell.html?full' width='700' height='20'></iframe>

Or, the smaller ("minified") file:

<iframe src='indexpage/include_nutshell.html?min' width='700' height='20'></iframe>

You can also download & re-host the files yourself ([full](todo), [minified](todo)). 

(Fun fact: Nutshell doesn't require a package manager; I copy-pasted all dependencies into it. Like a savage.)

Alas, some platforms like Medium and Substack don't let you add *any* code, not even *one line.* You can't use Nutshell on those platforms. ("The web will empower the people", they said...)

## : HTML/CSS/JS

Webpages are made of code. Specifically, 3 kinds of code: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**HTML** is the page's raw content. (HTML = HyperText Markup Language) 

**CSS** tells the page how to be stylish. (CSS = Cascading Style Sheets) 

**JavaScript** tells the page how to be interactive. (JavaScript has nothing to do with the programming language Java. It was... some marketing thing? Ugh, programming sucks.)

## : Don't Do This

don't do this.

you just *had* to open all of these, didn't you?

## : Open Source

**Open source** code is (*usually but not always\**) code that's free to use, remix & re-distribute â€“ even for profit, with no or few\** requirements.

\* "Free" is an annoyingly confusing word. *Very roughly speaking,* think "free as in freedom of the press", not necessarily "free as in Wi-Fi at Starbucks."

\** One common requirement is "give credit". Fair enough. Some open source licenses go further: they require that your remix *also* be published under the same license. These are called **copyleft** licenses. Licenses without that requirement are called **permissive** licenses.
